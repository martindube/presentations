## Description

Purple Teaming - From Silos to Heroes

Red always wins… when we work in silos! In this talk, we’ll share our journey through the evolution of internal Purple Team exercises, from the typical project-based approach to a continuous synergy with several teams. Taking inspiration from OODA loop, SOC operations and publicly available tools (Mitre ATT&CK, Vectr, git), we’ll share stories and, we hope, some words of wisdom.
